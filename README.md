Overview
---

In this project we apply the concepts from deep learning to have the car simulator 
drive by itself in the provided tracks

The project includes the Python and Keras files for the model. It also includes the
final write-up where I hope to explain my thinking process when solving this problem using neural networks. 
The folder named report_img  is used to store all the project resources used like training images, 
plots and videos. You can find these files named as follows:

* final\_writeup.md
* model.py
* model.h5
* drive.py
* model_video.mp4
* model\_weights.h5
